About
-----

Converge is an editorial content management system for small and medium-size 
media houses who need to manage content for multiple outlets and re-publish it 
on multiple platforms (e.g. web sites, mobile apps, and newsletters).

Converge supports the following key processes:

* Story writing - That is, the process of a writer securely typing a story directly in the system.
* Editorial review - That is, the process of passing a story through an editorial workflow where all changes are tracked.
* Newswire processing - That is, the process of creating a single view of newswires services where stories can be read and included in outlet editions.
* Forward planning - That is, the process of planning the content of an edition of an outlet. This inclues assigning stories to writers.

### Technology ###

Converge is a Java Enterprise Edition 6 (JEE6) applications and must be installed
 on a JEE6-compliant application server. Converge uses the Java Persistence API 
(JPA) and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to communicate with the database 
server and is therefore database independent. Converge has been extensively 
tested and used in production with the MySQL Database Server 5.5. User 
management is done through the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) such 
as OpenDS, OpenLDAP or Microsoft Active Directory. Converge operates on a full 
open source stack consisting of:

* Operating System: Ubuntu 12.04+ 
* Application Server: Glassfish v4.0 
* Database Server: MySQL Server 5.5 
* Web Server: Apache 2+
* Java Virtual Machine: Oracle Java 1.7
* Directory Service: OpenDS 2+

Converge can also operate on proprietary platforms using Microsoft Windows Server, 
Oracle Database and Application Servers, and Microsoft Active Directory.
